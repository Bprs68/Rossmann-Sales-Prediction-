<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*IpUXpwNleNMgpPFr.png">

<h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
<p>Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores
in 7 European countries. Currently,
Rossmann store managers are tasked with
predicting their daily sales for up to six
weeks in advance. Store sales are
influenced by many factors, including
promotions, competition, school and
state holidays, seasonality, and
locality.<br> With thousands of individual
managers predicting sales based on
their unique circumstances, the
accuracy of results can be quite
varied. You are provided with
historical sales data for 1,115
Rossmann stores. The task is to
forecast the "Sales" column for the
test set. Note that some stores in the
dataset were temporarily closed for
refurbishment.</p>
